You have to create some files before setting out your server. 

lastSeen.csv
money.csv
status.csv
statusTime.csv
tourwins.csv
usergroups.csv
elo.csv

All you have to do is make them and save a blank csv file. 
So when you will set your server these will work as codes. They will savethemseves so don't try adding anything else.
or you might end up making things worse.


I am lazy enough to teach you how to change codes and add things in those files above. But Contact me if you want to know
